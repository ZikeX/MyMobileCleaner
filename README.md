iPhone &amp; iPad Cleaner

Use SDMMobileDevice.framework instead of Apple's private framework MobileDevice.framework.
So it can be Sandboxed App for AppStore ^_^

Currently just clean crash log. (Apple has imposed more restrictions, we can not access installed app dir now.)
As a guy with obsessive-compulsive disorder, I still feel lucky to be able to clean my iPhones' crash log --!

## TODO ##

in Sandbox, app may lose its connections with device sometimes.
