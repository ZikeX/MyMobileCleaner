## iPhone &amp; iPad Cleaner ##

Currently just clean crash log. (Apple has imposed more restrictions, we can not access installed app dir now.)
As a guy with obsessive-compulsive disorder, I still feel lucky to be able to clean my iPhones' crash log :)

**Where is the crash log?**

**Settings -> Privacy -> Diagnostics & Usage -> Diagnostics & Usage Data**

With MyMobileCleaner, now it is not a problem.

The world is clear now ^_^
